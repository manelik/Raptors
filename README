README FILE FOR RAPTORS

RAPTORS IS BOUND TO BECOME THE GREAEST GAME FEATURING RAPTORS

STATUS

The program just handles objects called raptors,
the makefile throws an executable wich when run simulates a player chased by
a raptor. the output sucks by now, is a multicolumn textfile in the format

time player.x player.y charlie.x charlie.y

it may be ploted easyly with gnuplot, just save the output to some
'out.dat' and then
>plot 'out.dat' using 2:3 gives the path followed by player

and so on


TO DO

create some raptor's food, call them bunnies for the moment

would be interesting to populate some map with bunnies and raptors
raptors may have a hunger param, speed depends on hunger, may starve to death
may attack and feed on other raptors if too hugry

Added dev line
